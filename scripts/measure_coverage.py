"""Deterministic, stdlib-only line-coverage gate for scripts/*.py.

Runs the project's unittest suite in-process under the standard-library
``trace`` module, computes per-file executed-vs-executable line ratios (with an
audited OMIT manifest subtracted), prints a report, and exits non-zero if any
per-file floor or the total floor is breached.

Design notes
------------
* STDLIB ONLY. Uses ``trace`` for executed lines and ``code.co_lines()`` (via
  ``compile``) for the executable-line denominator — bytecode-derived truth,
  not a regex heuristic. No coverage.py / pytest / third-party.
* DETERMINISTIC. Floors are fixed integers (percentages) set BELOW the measured
  coverable maxima by a >=5-point margin (see PER_FILE_FLOORS), so a minor
  executable-set drift between the local interpreter and CI's python 3.12 cannot
  make a floor unreachable and wedge CI with a false red.
* The tool measures the product modules only; ``measure_coverage.py`` itself and
  the ``test_*.py`` files are excluded from the MEASURED set — the tool's own
  logic is covered by ``scripts/test_measure_coverage.py``.

Coverage semantics: this gate measures RUNTIME line coverage with CORRECTED
attribution. Inside ``tracer.runfunc`` it first re-imports the target modules
(replacing them in ``sys.modules``) and only THEN discovers and runs the suite —
so lines that execute only at import time (module-level constants, ``import``
statements, ``def``/``class`` header lines, decorators) run under the tracer and
ARE counted, while the discovered test modules still bind and ``mock.patch`` the
same freshly-traced module objects (single module identity — the ordering is
load-bearing; discovering before the re-import splits identity and breaks the
patches). A module's percentage therefore reflects lines the suite actually
reaches, and a fully-exercised module reads at ~100%. The only lines that remain
uncounted are ones that genuinely never run under a unit test — the
``if __name__ == "__main__"`` process-entry shims and the blocking
``serve_forever()`` daemon tail — which the audited OMIT manifest removes from both
numerator and denominator (it may not zero out a file; see ``validate_omit``).

Anti-false-green guards: the gate refuses to report coverage unless the suite
actually ran a plausible number of tests (``MIN_TESTS``), and the OMIT manifest
cannot zero out a file — omitted lines must be real executable lines and OMIT may
not remove more than ``MAX_OMIT_FRACTION`` of a file's executable lines.
