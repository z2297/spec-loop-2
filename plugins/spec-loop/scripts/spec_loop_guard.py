"""PreToolUse guard: deterministic enforcement of spec-loop's git invariants.

Registered by the plugin's hooks/hooks.json for Bash and Write|Edit tool calls.
While a spec-loop run is active (a `docs/spec-loop/<run-id>/.active` marker
exists under the project root), this hook mechanically blocks the operations
the loop's prompts forbid:

- `git push` before the human's publish choice (`.publish-choice` marker) —
  except in `per-slice-pr` merge mode, where slices legitimately push.
  Only pushes that plausibly belong to the run are denied: bare `git push`,
  pushes naming the run's integration branch (`base_ref`), or `spec-loop/`
  worktree branches.
- `git add -A` / `--all` / `git add .` — the runbook commit must stage only
  the run directory by explicit pathspec.
- `git commit` / `git merge` while sitting on `main`/`master` (or a compound
  command that checks out main and commits/merges/pushes) before the publish
  choice.
- Any write to the quality-gate config — the global file
  (`~/.claude/spec-loop-2/quality-gate.json`) or the per-repo overlay
  (`.spec-loop/quality-gate.json`) — thresholds must never be weakened mid-run.

Design decisions:
- **Fail-open on internal errors.** This hook is defense-in-depth; the skill
  prompts remain the primary control. A crashed guard must not deny every
  tool call in the session, so any unexpected exception allows the action.
- Denials **fail closed** with a reason that names the compliant alternative
  and the stale-marker remediation (`/spec-loop --resume <run-id>` or clearing
  the `.active` marker).
- Subagent coverage: verified empirically (2026-07-07, instrumented hook +
  headless `claude -p` probe) that PreToolUse fires for Bash calls made inside
  Task subagents as well as the main session — so this guard also covers slice
  workers. The platform docs don't state this explicitly, so it is worth
  re-probing after major Claude Code upgrades; every controller-owned operation
  (integration merge, runbook commit, publish push) runs in the main session
  regardless.

Standard library only. Reads the hook payload from stdin; a denial is exit 0
plus a permissionDecision JSON on stdout; an allow is exit 0 with no output.
