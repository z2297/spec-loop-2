# Verification Before Completion — evidence before any completion claim

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

This gate is the one spec-loop commitment that is never relaxed for autonomy. See the pinned note
below.

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command **in this message**, you cannot claim it passes.

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN:      Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ:     Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY:   Does output confirm the claim?
             - If NO: State actual status with evidence
             - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying
```

## What counts as evidence

Each claim has one thing that proves it. A stale, partial, or adjacent substitute proves nothing.

- **Tests pass** — the full test command's output, zero failures, run now.
- **Linter clean / build succeeds** — each tool's own output. A clean linter says nothing about
  whether the code compiles.
- **Bug fixed** — the original symptom retested, not merely code changed.
- **Regression test works** — the red-green cycle actually observed: write it, run (pass), revert
  the fix, run (**must fail**), restore, run (pass).
- **Requirements met** — the plan re-read and checked item by item. Passing tests are not a
  coverage argument.
- **A subagent completed its work** — the VCS diff (`git diff`, `git status`), never the agent's
  own report. This is load-bearing in spec-loop, and enforced structurally: a slice that returns
  `DONE` without full-suite evidence in its sidecar is demoted to `ESCALATED` before the controller
  will merge it.

## Scoped vs. full verification (single home)

Scoping narrows the *claim*, never the *gate*. Two rules:

1. **Scoped test evidence.** A *task-level* completion claim (one task inside a slice) may be
   verified by the task's **covering tests** — the test files/filters that exercise the files the
   task touched, named by the dispatcher or derived from the diff (`npm test -- <paths>`,
   `pytest <paths>`, `go test ./pkg/...`, `dotnet test --filter`, …). If the covering set cannot be
   derived confidently, or the change touches shared infrastructure (build config, DI wiring,
   shared utilities, schema, lockfiles), run the full suite — ambiguity never narrows the scope.
   Scoped evidence never substitutes for the three **full-suite checkpoints**, which may never be
   scoped: **(a)** slice verification before `DONE`, **(b)** the controller's wave integration
   gate, **(c)** the Phase 5 integration gate.
2. **Evidence transfer by tree identity.** Fresh full-suite evidence attaches to a *git tree*, not
   a branch: if `git rev-parse <A>^{tree}` equals the tree the suite was verifiably run on
   (command + result + tree SHA recorded — the sidecar's `tests.{command,result,scope,tree_sha}`),
   the claim "this tree is green" transfers without re-running. Any tree mismatch, missing record,
   or doubt → run the suite (fail closed). This is the only sanctioned way to skip a full-suite
   run, and it never applies to checkpoints (a) or (c) — a slice always runs its own verification
   suite (that run is the very evidence checkpoint (b) may transfer), and the Phase 5 gate always
   runs fresh.

## This gate is never overridden by the autonomy contract

**Pinned.** During an active spec-loop run, `spec-loop:escalation-gate` governs every *human*
checkpoint (design approval, consent-before-`main`, stop-and-ask, review BLOCK surfacing). It does
**not** govern this one. `verification-before-completion` is a hard, no-human, evidence-before-claims
gate and it stays in force at every layer of a run:

- **Implementer** — no task returns `DONE` without fresh passing output it has read, per the
  scoped-evidence rule above.
- **Slice verification** — the wave workflow's final stage runs the full suite and the quality gate
  in the worktree and reports what they actually said; `DONE` is only reachable through it, and
  earlier scoped task runs never satisfy it.
- **Controller merge gate** — no merge on a slice's word alone: the controller independently checks
  that the branch exists, that `commits.head` matches it, and that the sidecar carries full-suite
  evidence (`tests.scope == "full"`).
- **Integration gate (Phase 5)** — the run is not "green" until the integration verification
  command has been run and read fresh.

`escalation-gate` saying PROCEED never authorizes skipping this gate. The two are independent: one
decides *whether to interrupt the human*, this one decides *whether you have earned a completion
claim*. There is no autonomy exception and no human to wave it through — the evidence is the only
authority.

The blast radius inside a run is larger than in interactive work: an unverified `DONE` merges into
the integration branch and every downstream slice inherits a false foundation.

## When to apply

Before any claim of success, completion, or correctness — including paraphrases, implications, and
expressions of satisfaction. Concretely: before committing, opening a PR, returning a slice `DONE`,
a controller merge, the Phase 5 integration gate, moving to the next task, and accepting a result
from a subagent.

## When NOT to use this

This skill is never "not applicable" — the gate always stands. But if your situation is actually a
different one, reach for the sibling skill instead:

- You are **writing or fixing** code and need the discipline for *how* to build it test-first →
  `spec-loop:test-driven-development` (this skill only verifies the result).
- A test or build is **failing** and you need to find out *why* before you can verify anything →
  `spec-loop:systematic-debugging`. Return here once you have a fix to verify.
- You need to decide whether to **stop and ask the human** → `spec-loop:escalation-gate`. That is a
  separate decision and it never lets you skip this gate.

Run the command. Read the output. Then claim the result.
